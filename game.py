determining  when the game ends. it aslo allow players to attack coordinates, set the number
set the number of ships, and print the current state of the game

Inputs:
    - player_bank = [p1, p2]
    - User inputs for setting the number of ships and choosing attack coordinates.

Output:
    - Displays the current turn, player boards, and the results of attacks (hit/miss).
    - Declares the winner when the game ends.
